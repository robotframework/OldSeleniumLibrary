        `code` may contain multiple statements and the return value of last
        statement is returned by this keyword.

        `code` may be divided into multiple cells in the test data. In that
        case, the parts are catenated together without adding spaces.

        If `code` is an absolute path to an existing file, the JavaScript
        to execute will be read from that file. Forward slashes work as
        a path separator on all operating systems. The functionality to
        read the code from a file was added in SeleniumLibrary 2.5.

        Note that, by default, the code will be executed in the context of the
        Selenium object itself, so `this` will refer to the Selenium object.
        Use `window` to refer to the window of your application, e.g.
        `window.document.getElementById('foo')`.
