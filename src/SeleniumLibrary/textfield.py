        In normal usage the file specified with `file_path` must be available
        on the same host where the Selenium Server is running.

        An alternative usage is specifying the `file_path` with an URL
        (starting with `http://` or `https://`) in which case the file
        will be downloaded automatically. The limitations of this
        method are that it only works on Firefox and the file must be
        placed at the root level of a web server.

        | Choose File | my_upload_field | /home/user/files/trades.csv |
        | Choose File | my_upload_field | http://uploadhost.com/trades.csv |

        The support for remote files was added in SeleniumLibrary 2.3.2.
        It uses Selenium's `attach_file` method which is explained at
        http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2009/11/selenium-tip-of-the-week-upload-files-on-browsers-running-over-remote-machines/
